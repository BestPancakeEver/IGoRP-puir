This is a competetive multiplayer mod based on the historical 1836 Victoria 2 start. My aspiration is that one day we will be able to assemble a roster of 25 players, playing their nation to their fullest and negotiating and geopoliticing to their best. This mod aims to cater to this audience.This is a competetive multiplayer mod based on the historical 1836 Victoria 2 start.

This mod aims to cater to this audience.

The base of this mod is IGoR_puir 8.0.6 by Nurse_Reno, he can say that he has influenced my thinking about Victoria 2 gamedesign. I will further develop now that he has retired, we share a common philosophy, though we have important disagreements and I will develop this mod as I see fit, hopefully with much valuable feedback. I aim to first and foremost craft a mod that allow players to take important and meaningful decisions concerning their geopolitical strategy with holistic analysis of player decision making. I also wish to provide the player with organic tools and QoL features.

A MP ruleset that is complementary to the mod is supplied, though not required to use alongside the mod. Note that the ruleset can be very cumbersome for inexperienced GMs!
