	 - Milan
	 - Rome
	 
-Reintroduction of Anti-Italy;
 
     - Can be formed by the other Italian player immediatly after Italy Formation. Gets the same cores as Italy, but doesnt accept the other Italian culture (North/South Italian).
	 
	 - Given decision to accept the other Italian culture (North/South Italian), requires owning Milan and Rome (Symmetric to Italy Formation).

**General and Disparate Changes**

-Decoupled Zombies_MP_binds_1.2, due to popular uproar. Mapmodes whose keybinds were reassigned is in use much more than I anticipated.

-Party Loyality Gain on Election win and Party Loyality Loss on lost war is now both set to zero.

-Added Roster option of merging Australia into Canada (Capital will be Ontario) for the Commonwealth Released start. The UK can do this by decision in the first year.

**Bugfixes and Localisation**

-Fixed Scandinavia formation requiring a previously removed region, which blocked its formation. (Credit to GODOG)

-Removed legacy Baluchi culture as a accepted culture for Persia. (Oversight)

-Added missing Canada Cores on Newfoundland on Commonwealth Released start. (Oversight)

-Removed invalid Meme River crossing from Poltava to Krivoy Rog. (Oversight)

-Added Localisation for bricked province names with special letters, mainly in Scandinavia and Latin America. (For Modders: Localisation for these provinces usually brick, feel free to crop Province Localisation from "Pancake Changes.csv")

**For Modders**

-Set settings to Borderless mode, as it is more gentle to tabbing out of the game. (Credit to Potat) 
   
   Note:
   A vanilla issue had been resolved to implement this. Vanilla will launch a FALSE Borderless mode (fullScreen=yes, borderless=yes) which reverts to Fullscreen mode (TRUE Fullscreen is fullScreen=yes, borderless=no) while Settings UI will claim Borderless mode is applied (Note that switching settings from Borderless to Fullscreen will not prompt a "Restart Game to apply Changes" popup). Therefore for your mod to default to Borderless mode, its settings file must be TRUE Borderless (fullScreen=no, borderless=yes).

-Added exceptions for Add Core event for Islands apart of Continental regions, as a eligble Continental Province (Next to Core) will trigger the event to add the Core Integration Province Modifer to the **whole** region, including provinces that will never be eligble to be cored (Islands -> No neighbouring Cores). Islands will still not trigger the event to start integration, as they have no neighbouring Cores. This is to resolve Core Integration Province Modifers never expiring on provinces not eligble to become cores (The modifer gives Global Consciousness), the list of exceptions are currently;

	- Galapagos 
	- Easter Island
	- Lesser Antilles Islands NOT connected to South America by strait.
	- Jan Mayen
	- Gotland
	- Crete
	- Canary Islands
	- Balearic Islands
	- Socotra
	- Maldives
	- Andaman Islands
	- Cheju

Changelog - IGoRP Version 9.2

**SEA Rework**

-Added 3 South East Asia "Colonial Goverment" tags. These tags are releasable by Great Powers that own relevant territory for the respective tags. The tags are;
  
    - Federated Malay States (MLY) with Malay accepted
    - Thailand (THI) with Thai accepted
    - Indochina (ICU) with Vietnamese accepted
	
	(Credit for Assets to CWE)

-Colonial Goverment tags share some unique mechanics;

    - They must be played by a player (Atleast to trigger setup event), if not the tag will be reannexed into the releaser. Great Powers can only release one Colonial Goverment tag throughout the game!
	- Colonial Goverments benefit from a dynamic unciv reform inheritance mechanic. Colonial Goverments will receive reforms, if the releaser has researched techs one tier above what techs the reform would provide. For example, if the releaser has tier 2 mil tactics researched, the Colonial Goverment will receive the first mil tactics unciv reform (which gives tier 1 mil tactics tech).
    - On release, the Colonial Goverment will be given all provinces held by the releaser that is their primary culture. The Colonial Goverment will core all these provinces. (This means MLY can core Sulu and Bali through the setup event)

-Colonial Goverments have been given a decision to increase liferating in cores to 37LR, requires Nationalism And Imperialism (Repeatable). Federated Malay States also have a decision to core Aceh, requires State And Goverment.

-Removed strait from Tanjungpinang to Jambi. (Malacca strait)

**China Rework**

-Increased UK opinion in Burma, UK is now able to sphere Burma before China can get a CB on Burma.

-Peking Convention Decision now fires a event for Russia to demand Kyzyl from China.

-China Research Points On Conquest nerf has been removed, and Research Points On Conquest has been reworked for China. China Research Points On Conquest is now;
       
	- A Base Research Points On Conquest of 4%.
	- Amount of Research Points On Conquest given by reforms are reduced to 1/3rd.

The goal is to allow China to civilise around 1860 if it can attain much Research Points On Conquest. A passive china would civilise around 1867, and a China being targeted and killed off can be delayed to 1870 and longer.

**General and Disparate Changes**

**Bugfixes and Localisation**

-Passage uncorrectly stating Uncivs would get technologies from their Sphere Leader on the Westernisation button has been removed. (Credit to Orange You Say?)

-Uncivs can no longer get the mobilization size invention from Strategic Mobility. (Oversight)

Changelog - IGoRP Version 9.1

**Prussia and NGF Formation Rework**

-Prussia now looses Small Nation modifer when passing 4.5m pops, compared to 3.75m for every other nation. This is so Prussia can keep +2% mob size and other modifers for longer, as 1836 Prussia pop is 3.64m.

-Diplomacy national value now reduces MTTH to annex north german spherelings by 10% for Prussia.

-Added decision for Prussia to annex a random north german sphereling that has been sphered for atleast 10 years, costs 5 infamy and has a 1 year cooldown.

-North german sphereling annexation event MTTH has been seperated into major north german spherelings (>125k pops), and minor north german spherelings. Minor spherelings have shorter MTTH to be annexed. A Prussia succsessful in sphering Hannover, Holstein and Saxony, and retaining spheres over the North Germans can expect to annex most of them around 1850, and form NGF by 1855.
