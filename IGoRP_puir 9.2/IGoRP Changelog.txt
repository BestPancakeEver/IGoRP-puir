Changelog - IGoRP Version 9.2

**SEA Rework**

-Added 3 South East Asia "Colonial Goverment" tags. These tags are releasable by Great Powers that own relevant territory for the respective tags. The tags are;
  
    - Federated Malay States (MLY) with Malay accepted
    - Thailand (THI) with Thai accepted
    - Indochina (ICU) with Vietnamese accepted
	
	(Credit for Assets to CWE)

-Colonial Goverment tags share some unique mechanics;

    - They must be played by a player (Atleast to trigger setup event), if not the tag will be reannexed into the releaser. Great Powers can only release one Colonial Goverment tag throughout the game!
	- Colonial Goverments benefit from a dynamic unciv reform inheritance mechanic. Colonial Goverments will receive reforms, if the releaser has researched techs one tier above what techs the reform would provide. For example, if the releaser has tier 2 mil tactics researched, the Colonial Goverment will receive the first mil tactics unciv reform (which gives tier 1 mil tactics tech).
    - On release, the Colonial Goverment will be given all provinces held by the releaser that is their primary culture. The Colonial Goverment will core all these provinces. (This means MLY can core Sulu and Bali through the setup event)

-Colonial Goverments have been given a decision to increase liferating in cores to 37LR, requires Nationalism And Imperialism (Repeatable). Federated Malay States also have a decision to core Aceh, requires State And Goverment.

-Removed strait from Tanjungpinang to Jambi. (Malacca strait)

**China Rework**

-Increased UK opinion in Burma, UK is now able to sphere Burma before China can get a CB on Burma.

-Removed Chinese cores on Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet. On westernisation, China will get cores on provinces these substates have retained control over when inheriting them.

-Manchuria AI no longer has a chance to deny The Peking Convention.

-Peking Convention Decision now fires a event for Russia to demand Kyzyl from China.

-China Research Points On Conquest nerf has been removed, and Research Points On Conquest has been reworked for China. China Research Points On Conquest is now;
       
	- A Base Research Points On Conquest of 4%.
	- Amount of Research Points On Conquest given by reforms are reduced to 1/3rd.

The goal is to allow China to civilise around 1860 if it can attain much Research Points On Conquest. A passive china would civilise around 1867, and a China being targeted and killed off can be delayed to 1870 and longer.

Changelog - IGoRP Version 9.1

**Prussia and NGF Formation Rework**

-Prussia now looses Small Nation modifer when passing 4.5m pops, compared to 3.75m for every other nation. This is so Prussia can keep +2% mob size and other modifers for longer, as 1836 Prussia pop is 3.64m.

-Diplomacy national value now reduces MTTH to annex north german spherelings by 10% for Prussia.

-Added decision for Prussia to annex a random north german sphereling that has been sphered for atleast 10 years, costs 5 infamy and has a 1 year cooldown.

-North german sphereling annexation event MTTH has been seperated into major north german spherelings (>125k pops), and minor north german spherelings. Minor spherelings have shorter MTTH to be annexed. A Prussia succsessful in sphering Hannover, Holstein and Saxony, and retaining spheres over the North Germans can expect to annex most of them around 1850, and form NGF by 1855.
