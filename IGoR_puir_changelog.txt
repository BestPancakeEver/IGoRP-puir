Changes for 7.0

- Anti Italy has been removed.
- Unciv militancy change: Lowered the reduction of militancy, and increases to militancy, from unciv based event modifiers to a standard 0.01 / -0.01.
- Statue of Liberty rework:
	- Statue of Liberty decision now gives France an event to choose who in the western hemisphere receives the statue of liberty.
	- Statue of Liberty assimilation rate decreased from 100% to 25%.
- Unit Stats: (updated in Army Unit Stats file)
	- Planes are now balanced equally for attack and defense and won't have that awkward 12% support hanging around.
- Factory Changes:
	All Factories:
		- Maintenance costs have been lowered for cement from 0.5 to 0.25, and lumber has been added for a consumption of 0.25 (about 25% cheaper maintenance costs)
		- All factory construction now requires lumber.
	Fabrics:
		- Cotton factories now require 3 less cotton for input per tier.
		- Wool factories have been rebalance to only require 30 wool instead of 50. (Puts this in line to match profitability of cotton factories.)
		- Industrial Tannery (new building) has been added to provide an alternative source of fabric using cattle, and matching the same base profitability that cotton and wool have.
		- Having all 3 fabric factories in 1 state will buff a regular clothes factory in that state by 45% (15% each)
- Japan Buff
	- Japan now starts with 3 decisions to join UK, USA, or Russias sphere within the first year of the game (1836).
	- Japan now starts with 2 tech reforms, flintlock rifles and bronze artillery. (unlocking regulars and artillery day 1)

	- Removed social reform desire.
- AI Unit Priority Rework
	- AI will now build equal portion artillery / infantry and about a tenth of their units will be horses.
	- AI will now only build transports and light ships (beneficial for AI puppets, but the single player AI shits the bed)
- Complete Assimilation rework v2
	- Took me for literally ever, but now assimilation base line rate is the same for all pops and provinces in the game.
	- Rates:
		Increases: Everyday and Luxury good access, equality national value, and new world nation flagged nations in new world continents.
		Decrease: militancy, unemployment, and not meeting Life needs.
	I've put the specific rates but they will literally not make sense, just trust me bro.
	Balance Concept:
		Assimilation rates should never overcome pop growth rates of the minority. So, to understand how assimilation works now, view it as a sort of vampire/parasite that saps the pop growth of minorities to supplement the growing accepted cultures in the state/province.

Tibet is now cored by china and is considered a substate. This should allow tibet to be inherited upon chinese westernization. This is intended to cleanup the map because in 99% of games, tibet remains a chinese puppet all game.
Eliminated ainu pockets and replaced them with japanesse to help with lag.
Eliminated asian_minor pockets across asia and replaced them with their primary culture in their area to help with lag.
Completed Indian population rework. Pops are now defined by their language group to reduce lag (indo-aryan and dravidian). Doctrine of lapse does work properly with the new cultures.

Minimum wage reform now lowers life needs requirement for poor strata by 10% for each tier, up to 40% reduction.
African continent has been given cultures that reflect their historical language groups as accurately as I could. Generic domains should inherit these new cultures normally.
Chinese pops have been redone into 2 major groups, north han and south han. The periphery substates have the same pops. (mongol, manchu, etc)
Indian pops have been redone into 4 major culture groups: tamil, avadhi, marathi, and bengali. Bengali is the only non-accepted.

Generic Neutrality has been removed.

Assimilation has been completely reworked to be simplified and universal. You can now dependably begin assimilating pops, but it won't be fast. (No assimilation in colonies of course).
National Value Changes:
Order: Buffed starting experience to 30 from 25, added a Leadership bonus modifier which essentially doubles the monthly leadership point gain (good for fishing for good generals)
Autocracy: Buffed mobilization size from 1% to 2.5%
Productivity: Now gives 5% industry tech research bonus instead of commerce.
Equality: Now gives a 500% assimilation rate national focus. (works well in conjunction with Assimilation rework.)

	if redshirts pop in sardinia and win, two sicilies AUTOMATICALLY becomes italy
	if redshirts pop anywhere else in italy and win, sardinia AUTOMATICALLY becomes italy
	If either power is a great power and the other is not, they will AUTOMATICALLY become italy

Bugfixed a lot of issues with Anti Italy. It can no longer be released via CB or satellite. (bugfix)

----------------------------------------------------
Changes for 3.0.6

Rework for Italian formation:
	- If either Two Sicilies or Sardinia is a GP, that power is guaranteed to become Italy. If neither party is a Great Power upon formation, the target will be random between them.
	- The power that did not form italy will then be given the decision to become Anti-Italy, and have the same cores as Italy. Once one of the 2 Italian states own all of the peninsula's cores (including sicily but excluding sardinia, venetia, south tirol, and istria) they will be able to wipe all the opponents cores off of Italy.
	- Anti-Italy is literally just Italy but they have cores on one another to restore order / core war.

----------------------------------------------------
Changes for 3.0

Japan now starts with 500 clipper goods so they are no longer hostage to the world market at the start.
Colonial migration rework now allows colonial pops who are unemployed to move to other colonies within your control for employment. (Most effectively seen with Indian colonies + Chinese Colonies)
tl;dr Foreign investment is very important now. The base sphere market guarantees from secondaries (50%) and civs (75%) have now been reduced to 0. This means that the % of your foreign investment in your sphereling corresponds to your ratio of their goods you acquire. Sphere guide goes into more detail, but foreign investing in an enemies sphereling and bringing their total % down directly reduces the amount of goods they get from that sphereling into their sphere market by that amount. 
All economic policies can now give and receive foreign investment.
Sphere influence malluses in regards to population have been removed. If you border target country - 50% more influence, your sphere borders target country - 25% more influence, different continent - 25% less influence, and a scaling score ratio mallus / boon based on how low the GP score is relative to the target they are trying to sphere.
Grants have been fixed to allow larger amounts to be transferred.
Added a decision for players that have had a states factory hijacked by non-core pops as the craftsmen. It will convert them out of craftsmen so the earlier you do it the better. The decision has more information in its info box.
Reduced mean time to happen for core integration event from 80 months to 40 months, effectively halving the base amount. It is still sped up by revolution and counter revolution tech + nationalism and imperialism + low militancy. Slowed down by high militancy.
Made Planes functionally artillery instead of cavalry (oversight)
Made Tanks functionally cavalry instead of infantry (oversight)
Horse inventions (hussar, dragoon, cuirassier) are now 100% invention chance.
Machine guns invention is now a 100% invention chance.
Mission to Civilize, Colonial Negotiations, and Indigenous Garrisoning (all the colonial inventions) now have a 100% invention chance IF any other GP has already discovered it.
Changed Latin Monetary Union from -1% import cost (broken) and -5% tarrif efficiency to +5% tax efficiency.
Ethiopia has been deleted as a starting nation and all of its land has been set to 20 liferating so that it is apart of the middle stage african colonization.
Added modified hpm national values (heavily modified) and the ability to change them as any country any 10 years to any of the national values.
Added cross colonial migration hooked directly into unemployment. (Unemployed colonial pops will, rather quickly, migrate to other colonies where they will be employed.) They behave normally in regards to colony to state and colony to emigration.
Doctrine of Lapse now works accordingly for both civilized and uncivilized India, they must still be a british puppet though.
Max warscore from battles is now 25, from 50.
Australia and Canada have had their minorities removed to see if this solves the assimilation soldier bug causing those idiots to have 17% soldiers.
Changed bonus import cost from owning suez and panama (it did nothing) to 5% tax efficiency.
Colonial pops can now migrate to your states if they meet a literacy threshold of atleast 70%, increasing in chance at 80%, 90%, and 100%. (You'll start seeing movement at 70%). Primary and accepted pops in your colonies will NOT be affected by this change.
China Rework:
	China is now playable for multiplayer.
	Until 1865 china cannot build any other CB except humiliate, cut down to size, and reparations.
	Until 1865 only limited wargoals are available on china: treaty port / substate region / reparations / etc you can check for yourself.
	Added a china specific concession CB that costs 400% more warscore for when it is unciv. Once China westernizes, they will be using typical civ CBs.
	China will be nerfed by 80% of its starting pop down to 21 million pops, 17 million of which are accepted, these numbers are excluding the substates which auto annex upon westernization. ( Comparable to Russian pop by 1865 )
	The 3 untouchable Chinese puppets have been integrated into greater china.
	China now accepts Southern Han. Taiping now accepts Manchu and Southern Han. (just in case)

Classless society now no longer gives -20% morale and -20% discipline. It now gives +.01% mobilization. (commie buff)
